## 🧩 Connectivity & Device Handling
- pause workout when bike disconnected, and maybe don't start workout if bike disconnected

## 🖥️ UI / UX Issues & Improvements
- in product modals, or ideally local popup above FTP when selecting
- there should be time tick marks on the x axis

## ⚙️ Workout Execution & Behavior
- erg and resistance flows are not implemented
- when workout ends, stop the timer, and continue showing target power, and also stop/save the workout

## 📄 File, Data, and Parsing
- the workout history docs should also contain the zwo file (or at least the name and segments)
- maybe not necessary to put metrics in the zwo file or description?
- fix parsing of 1min 50sec @ 85rpm, 136W at https://whatsonzwift.com/workouts/threshold/atoverunder
- fix misclassificaiton of Over Under and Beyond as VO2max
- add url to workout website source
