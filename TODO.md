- if HRM disconnect during workout, try to reconnect
- erg and resistance flows are not implemented
- beep if the power change is greater than 5% to next interval, and the low beep is not audible

- there are white lines between the segments in the workout chart
- there should be time tick marks on the x axis
- pause message 0.5 second longer
- button focus should not have blue border
- bluetooth auto reconnect bug: says "Bike BLE ready, sending initial trainer state." and then gets marked as successful
- do siren 10s before big spike, and different soudns for start vs end interval
- pause workout when bike disconnected, and maybe don't start workout if bike disconnected
- when hrm or bike is disconnected, show -- in the big numbers
- the workout history docs should also contain the zwo file (or at least the name and segments)
- maybe not necessary to put metrics in the zwo file or description?
- when workout ends, stop the timer, and continue showing target power, and also stop/save the workout
- investigate stability of the timer (uses system clock instead of settimeout)
- workout selector should remember filters and also have hotkeys for workout types.
